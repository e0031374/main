== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tagline/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tagline/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `contact delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tagline/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` which is made up of four parts, i.e. `StatusBarFooter`, `HelpWindow`, `ChatPane` and `ResultPane`. In particular,

*  The `ChatPane` manages text interaction with the user. It uses `CommandBox` to read commands and `DialogBox` to display commands and feedback.

.Structure of the Chat Pane sub-component
image::UiChatPaneClassDiagram.png[]

*  The `ResultPane` displays a relevant `ResultView` based on the command entered.

.Structure of the Result Pane sub-component
image::UiResultPaneClassDiagram.png[]

All these classes, including the `MainWindow` itself, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tagline/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Displays feedback and updates the `ResultPane` using `CommandResult` in the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tagline/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TaglineParser` class to parse the user command.
.  The user command is passed to different command parser based on the command type. E.g. __"note delete 1"__ will be passed to `NoteCommandParser`
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a note).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

==== Contact Logic component
.Structure of the Contact Logic Component
image::ContactLogicClassDiagram.png[]

. `Contact Logic` is a sub-component of `Logic`.
. `TaglineParser` will pass a user input that can be classified as a contact command (i.e. has __"contact "__ prefix),
to the `ContactCommandParser` without including the __"contact"__ keyword, e.g. `TaglineParser` will only pass
__"create --n Bob"__ instead of __"contact create --n Bob"__.
. `ContactCommandParser` identifies the type of contact command and passes the argument string to the respective command
parser. For example, `ContactCommandParser` will pass __"--n Bob"__ to `CreateContactParser` if it receives
__"create --n Bob"__ as an input.
. This results in a `ContactCommand` object which is returned to the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `ContactModel`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the
`execute("contact create --n Bob")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `contact create --n Bob` Command
image::ContactCreateSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Note Logic component

[[fig-NoteLogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Note Logic Component
image::NoteLogicClassDiagram.png[]

.  `Note Logic` is a sub-component of `Logic`.
.  It obtains the user command parsed by `TaglineParser` through the `NoteCommandParser` class.
.  The user command is passed to the respective command parser. E.g. __"note delete 1"__ will be passed to `DeleteNoteParser`.
.  This results in a `NoteCommand` object which is returned to the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `NoteModel` (e.g. adding a note).

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("note delete 1")` API call.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tagline/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* manages Address Book data through `ContactModel` sub-component.
* manages Note Book data through `NoteMode` sub-component.

[[Design-ContactModel]]
==== Contact Model component

.Structure of the Contact Model Component
image::ContactModelClassDiagram.png[Contact Model Diagram, 625, 500]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tagline/model/contact/ContactModel.java[`ContactModel.java`]

The `ContactModel`,

* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>` which can be accessed from `Model` that can be 'observed' e.g. the
UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-NoteModel]]
==== Note Model component

.Structure of the Note Model Component
image::NoteModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tagline/model/note/NoteModel.java[`NoteModel.java`]

The `NoteModel`,

* stores the Note Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Note>` which can be accessed from `Model` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As an additional feature to be implemented in the future, we can store a `Tag` list in `Note`. This would allow `Note` to be able to be better categorized.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageArchitectureDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tagline/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.

[[Design-ContactStorage]]
==== Contact Storage component

* can save the Note Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `tagline.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== [Proposed] Chatbot prompting feature

==== Description

When the user enters an incomplete command, the command could be missing only a few compulsory fields. Instead of forcing the user to edit the command entirely, TagLine will prompt the user for further details instead.

At this point, the user may abort the command or provide the requested details. When all details are provided, the command is executed.

==== Proposed Implementation

The prompting mechanism uses `Prompt` objects to represent individual queries for additional information. A list of `Prompt` objects is used to pass information between the `Logic` and `Ui` components. `Prompt` implements the following operations:

`Logic` side:

* `Prompt#setPrefix()` -- Sets the prefix of the queried data
* `Prompt#setQuestion()` -- Sets the prompt to be displayed to the user
* `Prompt#getResponse()` -- Gets the prompt response from the user

`Ui` side:

* `Prompt#getQuestion()` -- Gets the prompt to be displayed to the user
* `Prompt#setResponse()` -- Sets the response from the user

Given below is an example scenario where the user command has missing compulsory fields.

Step 1: The `Ui` passes the user's command to `Logic`, which finds one or more missing compulsory fields. For each missing field, it creates a new `Prompt` object with a question. Then it throws a `ParseException` containing the list of `Prompt` objects.

image::UserPromptSequenceDiagramStep1.png[]

Step 2: The `Ui` receives the list of `Prompt` objects. For each `Prompt`, it retrieves the question and obtains the corresponding user feedback.

image::UserPromptSequenceDiagramStep2.png[]

Step 3: The `Ui` passes the original command, together with the processed `Prompt` objects, back to `Logic`. `Logic` then executes the corrected command.

image::UserPromptSequenceDiagramStep3.png[]

The user can also abort the command by entering a special string. In this case, the `Ui` will discard the original command and continue to receive further user commands.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Command correction method

* **Alternative 1**: The `Ui` updates the command with the user's responses by adding the new data to the command string.
** Pros: No need to overload `Logic#execute()` and `Parser#parse()` methods
** Cons: Requires `Ui` to know where to insert preambles, and increases coupling between `Ui` and `Logic` components (as `Ui` now needs to know and follow the command format)
* **Alternative 2** (chosen): The `LogicManager` updates the command with the user's responses by adding the new data to the command string.
** Pros: No need to overload `Parser#parse()` method
** Cons: Requires all commands to follow the same general format
* **Alternative 3**: The `Parser` handles the `Prompt` objects when parsing the command
** Pros: Easily handles preambles and allows greater extensibility of the prompt feature, e.g. can have the user fix incorrect commands
** Cons: Requires changing every `Parser` class, decreases maintainability in the long run

=== [Proposed] Group Contacts feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The grouping feature is facilitated by `GroupBook` an additional Model component in addition to the current `AddressBook`.
It extends the functionality of `AddressBook` by providing a way to group contacts together into unique `Group` classes
identified by their `GroupName`. This allows users to form more natural associations of
contacts such as "BTS-members". Identifying which contacts are group members of a `Group` is done by
storing a record of their `ContactId` in the `Group`.
Additionally, `GroupManager` extends Tagline with the following operations:

* `GroupManager#getGroupBook()` -- Retrieves a view only version of the groups for storing data after app quits.
* `GroupManager#deleteGroup()` -- Deletes a group from the list of groups currently available.
* `GroupManager#addGroup()` -- Adds a group to the list of groups currently available.
* `GroupManager#setGroup()` -- Replaces a group in the list of groups with another group.
* `GroupManager#getFilteredGroupList()` -- Returns a view only list of groups containing a subset of available Groups.
* `GroupManager#updateFilteredGroupList()` -- Specifies which groups will be retrieved by `GroupManager#getFilteredGroupList()`.

The above operations are exposed in the `Model` interface by their respective method names.

* `GroupCommand#findOneGroup()` -- Retrieves one Group with name matching the exact provided String.
* `GroupCommand#verifyMemberIdWithModel()` -- Compares members currently in a group with contacts in `AddressBook` and returns only those found in `AddressBook`.
* `GroupCommand#setDifference()` -- Used to get contactids specified which do not exist in `AddressBook`.

These above are static utility functions which form the underlying structure of how a `GroupCommand` works.

Given below is an example usage scenario on how a typical lifecycle of a `Group` behaves at each step.
With emphasis on showing the effects of `FindGroupCommand` as an example of a `GroupCommand`.

Step 1. The user initially has several contacts in `AddressBook`.

.Simplified state of relevant Model components initially
image::GroupContactsState0.png[]

Step 2. Wishing to better organize her contacts into groups, the user executes `group create BTS` calling
 `CreateGroupCommand`. to create a new `Group` instance with no members.

.State after Group "BTS" is created
image::GroupContactsState1.png[]

Step 3. The user then executes `group add BTS --i 00001 --i 00002 --i 0003 --i 0004`
 calling the `addMembersToGroupCommand` to add several contacts to the group. Only the String
 representation of the `ContactId` will be stored in the `Group`.

.State after four contacts are added into Group "BTS"
image::GroupContactsState2.png[]

Step 4. The user may wish to remove some contacts calling `contact delete --i 0003`
 which then deletes the `Contact` with contactId of 3. However, this does not remove the contact's id from
 the memberId attribute in the `Group` the contact was in. This step does not involve `GroupModel` in any way.

.State after contact with contactId = 00003 is deleted
image::GroupContactsState3.png[]

Step 5. The user executes `group find BTS` to call up all members on the `Group` and view the `Contact` profiles.
 This calls `FindGroupCommand` which then updates the `Group` ensuring that all memberIds correspond to an existing
 `ContactId` found in `AddressBook`. The contacts of the group are also displayed to the user.

.State after user views contacts of Group "BTS"
image::GroupContactsState4.png[]

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `FindGroupCommand` which
 which updates the `Group`:

.Sequence diagram of executing `FindGroupCommand` to view contacts in a `Group`
image::GroupSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How groups stores contacts

* **Alternative 1:** Stores `ContactId` class in a `Collection` in `Group`
** Pros: Easy to get `ContactId` from `Group` to retrieve `Contact` classes from `Addressbook`.
** Cons: Increases coupling to implementation of `Contact`. Storage and retrieval after reloading the app would also
 cause new instances of `ContactId` to be created when loading `Group` or would require more complicated
 loading of `Group` from storage having to happen after `AddressBook` is loaded and having to reference
 `Contact` classes to ensure the same `ContactId` class is referenced by both `Contact` and `Group` it is in.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Stores `Collection` of Strings which are able to uniquely identify `Contact`.
** Pros: Group classes are less coupled to implementation of `Contact`. Simpler to load `Group` classes from storage.
 due to not needing to check and obtain a reference to `ContactId`. User input is also parsed as Strings.
** Cons: Deciding when to check if members are still part of a `Group` since it need not be done at loading time.
 While it is more flexible, can be a potential source of confusion as it may be possible to forget to update
 the members in `Group`.

// end::groupcontacts[]

=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
