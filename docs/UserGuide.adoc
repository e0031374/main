== Introduction

TagLine is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing notes.
More importantly, TagLine is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TagLine can
streamline your note management much faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Quick Start
to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
.  Download the latest TagLine.jar here.
.  Move the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for TagLine. You are recommended to create a new folder for TagLine as it will create files to store your data.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  The panel on the left is the Chatbot Interface. Type a command in the message box and press Enter to execute it.
.  Some commands you can try:
- `contact list`: Lists all contacts
- `note list`: Lists all notes
.  Your output will be displayed on the panel on the right. For more features on each command, refer to the Command List.
.  Refer to <<Command List>> for details of each command.
